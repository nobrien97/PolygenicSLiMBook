# Introduction

## Preface

The past couple of decades have seen the development of powerful computer systems that have become pervasive 
in every human endeavour. Scientists have long regarded computation as a helpful tool for tackling difficult problems, 
however leaps in computational power have opened up research opportunities that simply did not exist before. 
Such is the case with forward-genetics simulation. Although such simulations have existed since the mid-2000s[^fn1], 
their use was limited due to the computational requirements of forward-time simulations being unmatched by the hardware 
of the time. SLiM changes that, taking advantage of modern computers and an easy-to-learn scripting language that makes 
forward-genetics simulations relatively straightforward. While thorough documentation on introducing biologists to SLiM 
already exists in the form of the [SLiM manual](http://benhaller.com/slim/SLiM_Manual.pdf), for those studying complex, 
polygenic traits, there is a fair amount of trial and error. Unless you have happened across this document, in which I will 
provide a plethora of templates, tutorials, and tips that I have learned through my time experimenting with SLiM, as well 
as provide detail on where to find additional help.


## Overview

In this book, I'll cover:

    cd, pwd, mkdir, and creating a custom mkcdir command
    installing and updating software (apt get) - cowsay fortune
    shortcuts (tab, arrow keys, !, etc.)
    Linux filesystem, file descriptors, input/output
    sed, grep, | and < and >
