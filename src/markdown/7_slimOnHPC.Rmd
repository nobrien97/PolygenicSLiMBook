# 7.1 Overview

When running SLiM simulations, it is often necessary to run many more than you have CPU cores available
on your PC or laptop. As such, even with all cores going at once, you'll still be looking at a long time 
to wait to get any data back. Luckily, high-performance computing (HPC) clusters exist which allow you
to use hundreds or thousands of cores concurrently. Using the same methods as the previous chapter, 
we can extend our parallelism to much larger systems. In this chapter, I'll be providing some examples of
how to use the University of Queensland's [Tinaroo](https://rcc.uq.edu.au/tinaroo) system. Most universities
will have access to a similar system, and although there may be some differences in the syntax of some scripts,
the concepts remain the same.
