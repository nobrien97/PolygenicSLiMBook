# Pickover test
# â€œPickover describes a simple but quite effective technique for testing RNGs visually. 
# The idea is to generate random numbers in groups of three, and to use each group to plot 
# a point in spherical coordinates. If the RNG is good, the points will form a solid sphere. 
# If not, patterns will appear. From: https://www.r-bloggers.com/2017/09/how-good-is-that-random-number-generator/
